# MoonRocksSemanticSegmentation

- the dataset is taken from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/romainpessia/artificial-lunar-rocky-landscape-dataset)

- My approach is the following:
- first, try to extract features and then apply Random forests!
- Second, try Unet!

## Dataset:
"The dataset currently contains 9,766 realistic renders of rocky lunar landscapes, and their segmented equivalents (the 3 classes are the sky, smaller rocks, and larger rocks). A table of bounding boxes for all larger rocks and processed, cleaned-up ground truth images are also provided. We recommend that users check the "Understanding and Using the Dataset" kernel for additional information and guidelines on how to use the dataset effectively"
